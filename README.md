This is a subscription blocklist for use with ad-blockers, such as [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) and [uBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).

This blocklist will block known crasher/lagger items (e.g. pets) from loading in Whirled. They will be replaced with an "ERROR" image.

## Usage
